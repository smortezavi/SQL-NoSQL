* **Files:**

  * [pgAdmin_and_Postgres_for_Mac.md](Activities/01-Evr_Installations/Resources/pgAdmin_and_Postgres_for_Mac.md)

  * [pgAdmin_and_Postgres_for_Windows.md](Activities/01-Evr_Installations/Resources/pgAdmin_and_Postgres_for_Windows.md)

  * [Installation videos for Mac and Windows](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/DataViz-Lesson-Plans/blob/copyedit/issue-2964/sql-day-1/01-Lesson-Plans/09-SQL/VideoGuide.md)

* Announce to the class that they will need to install a coding environment capable of executing SQL queries.

* Slack out the supplemental guides for students to use for installing pgAdmin and Postgres on their machines.

* Explain to the class that the installations are identical save for the visual components.

* Begin walking the class through the installation, explaining each step as you go:

  * Visit the download link for [PostgreSQL](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) and select the operating system appropriate for your machine.

  * After the file has been downloaded, Mac users will click on the `postgresql-11.1-1-osx` file.

  * Windows users will click on the `postgresql-11.1-1-windows-x64.exe` file.

  * Navigate through the Setup Wizard and install PostgreSQL. The default location is: `/Library/PostgreSQL/11`.

  * Select the components to be installed. **Be sure to un-check `Stack Builder`**.

  * Mac users will see the following window:

  * Windows users will see the following window:

  * Next, add your Data Directory. The default location is: `/Library/PostgreSQL/11/data`.

  * When prompted, enter a password. **Be sure to record this password for future use.**

  * Set default port as `5432` and in the Advanced Options, locale can be set as `[Default locale]`.

  * The final screen will be the `Pre Installation Summary`.

  * Once the installation is complete, Mac users will find a folder in their Applications with these files:

  * Windows users will be able to access the same files by clicking the start menu on their computer and scrolling to the `Postgres 11` folder.

* Open pgAdmin, which will open in a new browser tab, and verify that everyone is connected to a local Postgres server before moving on to the next activity.

  * Students will need to input their password to connect to the server.

  * **Note:** If the computer seems non-responsive when starting pgAdmin, quickly reboot the machine and try again.

* Make sure that everyone has Postgres installed and a server running before continuing the lesson.
